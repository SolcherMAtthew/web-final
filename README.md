# web-final

This website is built to give instructions and access to a code I made with my highschool Programming teacher as a independant study.
There are four pages, the title page, that gives background on what the project is, the code page witch links to the github download of the code, and also contains a java game, the how to file,witch explains the rules of the game and tells how to use it. The last page is a contact page, giving my email, and giving accses to a submition box. The colors are meant to be aesy to read, while having a dark space theme. There is red matching the logo. I learned quite a bit about how to code and design web, and learned how to put a java file into a website. This was also the most challenging part of the website.
