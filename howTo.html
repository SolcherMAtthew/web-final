        <h2>How to use the code</h2>
            <dl>
       The game has a simple ruleset. It's a turn based strategy game, and you have several tools you can use each turn:
                <dl> <b>Energy:</b>Energy is your health bar and how you power your tools. You gain 10 each turn. You have a maximum of 100.</dl>
                
                <dl> <b>Laser:</b>The laser is your primary weapon. You can use it each turn, and does damage based on how much energy is put into it. you can put between 1 and 99 energy into a shot. The laser does 3 times the energy put in.</dl>
                
                <dl><b>Sheild:</b> The shield can be used for five energy every turn to block damage. However, the sheild is not a perfect block. If used multiple turns in a row, it's strength detiriorates. The sheild blocks 100% the first time, but if used the next turn only works at half power. Every turn used in a row turns cuts how much damage it blocks in half. it doubles its current block every turn it isn't used, maxing at 100%.</dl>
                
                <dl><b>Absorb:</b> This can be used every turn, for free, but only has a 50% chance of sucseeding. If it does, It blocks all damage, and gives you the amount of energy put into a shot. </dl>
       The Code can be run in any Java compiler, and all rules can be modified in the Space Fight Config.
